{{GlossarySidebar}}

CSS **physical properties** provide are CSS properties that define positions based on physical directions - such as {{cssxref("top")}}, {{cssxref("right")}}, {{cssxref("bottom")}}, and {{cssxref("left")}} - referring to the physical dimensions of the viewport, or reference specific sides of an element, and style features by that physical direction, such as {{cssxref("margin-top")}}, {{cssxref("border-right")}}, {{cssxref("padding-bottom")}}, and {{cssxref("border-bottom-left-radius")}}.

This is opposed to {{glossary("logical properties")}}, which are relative to the content flow and use directional keywords that are relative to the block and inline axes.
